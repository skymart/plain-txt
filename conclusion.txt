Conclusion

	Black holes are the most mysterious and unknown entities in the universe.  Scientists have used black holes to justify string theory or even the existence of the known universe.  Unfortunately, researching black holes is nearly impossible as their gravity is so strong that not even light can escape the singularity at the center.  This means no information can exit the event horizon, thus causing research to be nearly impossible.  It is likely black holes will be the greatest celestial mystery for years to come.
