Space is still the great frontier for humanity. Very little is known about the origins of the cosmos and how energy and time work in hand in hand with quantum mechanics to govern our universe.  One of the greatest mysteries in the cosmos are black holes.  Even after a century of studying black holes, scientist still debate on some of the fundamental characteristics of black holes.  In this paper, one will learn what is currently know about the black holes, the scientific history of the subject, and what is still just theory.
Albert Einstein first theorized the existence of black holes in 1915 with his theory of general relativity.  A year later Karl Schwarzchild used Einstein’s theory to define the gravitational radious of a black hole. After Schwarzchild formally defined black holes in 1916, it wasn’t until the late 1950’s that scientists began to have the tools necessary to observe and study black holes.  In 1958, David Finkelstein indentified the surface of a black hole as the event horizon.  He described the event horizon as, “a perfect unidirectional membrane: causal influences can cross it in only one direction.”  Twelve years later, in 1970, Stephen Hawking defined the modern theory of black holes.  Later that same year, the Cygnus X-1 telescope discovered what is thought to be the first observed black hole.  Finally, in 1994, the Hubble Space Telescope discovered the existence of supper massive black holes at the centers of many galaxies. 
While black holes are one of the most mysterious entities in the universe, scientists still have a good understanding of their basic properties.  The first principal charectoristic of a black hole is that it’s gravitational field is so strong that nothing, not even electro magnetic radiation, can escape.  The boundry at which nothing can escape is known as the event horizon.  At 1.5 times the radious of the event horizon is the phonton sphere.  The phonton shere is a region where photons get stuck is as they circle the center of the black hole.  Finally, the center of a black hole is defined as a singularity.  A singularity is a point in space where the limit of the present gravitational field approaches infinity.  While all all black holes share these general charectoristics, they do not all share the same size, rotation, or electric charge.  Black holes generally form from the collapse of a star.  They then grow in size has they consume more and more mass.  Some black holes consume so much mass they become classified as supper massive black holes.  Supper massive black holes are found at the center of galexies and are millions of times more massive then the sun.  While all black holes posses an event horizon and a singularity at their center, each is unique in its size, rotation, and electric charge.
With their theorization just over a 100 years ago and first observation less then 50 years a go, there is still a lot that is unknown about black holes.  One of the greatest mysteries surrounding black holes is whether they conservative information.  This is an important topic in the world of physics as the conservation of information is one of the key pillars to the theory of quantum mechanics. Because nothing can escape a black hole, many believe that information associated with matter consumed by a black hole is also lost.  However, Steven Hawaking theorized that black holes do not break the theory of quantum mechanics and that information is in fact conserved.  Hawaking believes black holes should emit very small amounts of thermal radiation containing  information regarding the mass the black hole has consumed.  Scientists are still working to this day to validate this theory but if it were to be true, it would also mean that black holes can slowly die as they emit energy.  With so much unknown about balck holes, it will be interesting to see what the next 100 years have in store.  
From the time they were theorized just over 100 years ago, black holes have been at the center stage of the physics community.  However, because they do not allow any light to escape, they have been relatively difficult to study and were first observed less then 50 years ago.  To this day, many questions still remain about the true nature of black holes and whether they conserve any energy.  With the nearest black hole to earth being thousands of light years away, it is likely humans will never know their true nature.  However, with their key role in modern physics and integral role in defining quantum mechanics, expect scientists to continue to reaserch them for centuries to come.
