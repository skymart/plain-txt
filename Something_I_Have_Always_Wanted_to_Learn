information gathered on black holes
1) nothing can escape a black hole including light and elctro-magnetic radiation
2) event horizon of black hole is boundrey where no matter or information can escape
3) they reflect no light
4) black holes are generic prediction of general relativity
5) black holes form when large stars colapse
6) can become larger as cobine with other black holes and suck up more mass
7) Black holes can be detected through interaction with other matter
8) When gravatational waves were observed earlier this year it was due to balck holes merging together.
9) beginning of 1960's marked golden age in black hole discovery
10) In 1958, David Finkelstein identified the surface of a black hole as an event horizon, "a perfect unidirectional membrane: causal influences can cross it in only one direction
11) theory of black hole thermodynamics developed in 1970's by hawking and crew
12) external gravity field is identical to any other object of same mass
13) black holes also warp time.  Time moves more slowly near event horizon compared to away from black hole
14) the singularity of a black hole has zero volume but contain all of black holes mass
15) singularity has infinite density
16) Three types of balck holes: Rotating, electrically charged, and not rotating or electrically charged.
17) strugle for scientists to relate quantom physics and gravatiy with black holes as they operate on quantom level but have gravity
18) black holes have phonton sphere 1.5 times the radious of the event horizon where phots get stuck in circular path about black hole
19) exsistince of black holes show mass was not uniformally distributed after big bang
20) Steven hawking predicts black holes should emit small amounts of thermal radiation.
21) If this theory is true black holes would slowly evaporate over time
22) This theory also bring up information loss paradox, violates quantom mechanics
23) through more research, scientists seek to determine whther info is actually lost in black holes
